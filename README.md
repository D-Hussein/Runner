This repository contains the Runner game developed with unity as the GMD course project by Diyar Hussein.

Some libraries and binary files have been gradually uploaded and some were discarded due to the size of the files, please pay attention that this might cause issues with running the project directly, In that case, importing the assets from this project to a new unity project could be the best way to run it.

-The script files can be found in Assets/scripts.
